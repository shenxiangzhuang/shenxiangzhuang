# About [Mathew Shen]
- ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm a Machine learning Engineer at [NetEase Fuxi](https://fuxi.163.com/). And I'm focusing on Data-Centric AI.

- ðŸ”­ Previously, I went to [ByteDance](https://github.com/bytedance) 
and worked on algorithm research and deployment in the AIOps field. 
The main research directions were time series forcast/anomaly detection, root cause analysis, etc., 
with the main goal being to detect system failures in advance 
and locate the root cause timely to reduce MTTR (Mean time to repair)
based on Metrics, Log, and Trace.


- ðŸ”­ Before that, I used to work on algorithm research related to network security(risk management) at 
[Tencent](https://github.com/Tencent), 
mainly focusing on anomaly detection algorithms based on association analysis 
and subspace clustering, with the application direction being anti-robot.
I am very happy that our algorithm is effective and has intercepted many attacks. 
I am also very grateful to my leader Mr. Liao, 
whose years of experience in the security field have greatly helped me in my work.

- ðŸ”­ Prior to this, I majored in statistics in both undergraduate(HNU) and graduate(SYSU) studies.
